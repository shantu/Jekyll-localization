  <ul>
    <li>
      &emsp;Video consultations in healthcare present an approximation of
      face-to-face interaction and are a “visual upgrade” of widely used
      telephone consultations;
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Evidence for the effectiveness of video consultations is scarce, but
      points towards effectiveness, safety, and high satisfaction in patients
      and healthcare providers; and
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Be prepared to switch from a video to a telephone or in-person
      consultation, depending on technical, patient, or clinical factors.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&emsp;6.6. Considerations for using video consultations</p>
  <p>
    &emsp;You agree that technical considerations listed here are not essential
    for conducting a video consultation, but are likely to make a difference to
    the quality and safety of the video consultation meetings:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      &emsp;Hardware—use a desktop or laptop computer with high quality
      audio-video capabilities. Seek IT advice about computer’s specifications:
      video calling capabilities depend on age, speed, and quality of processor
      and graphic card, among others.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Monitor, speakers, and microphone—for monitors, if possible, use two
      full high definition (HD) resolution screens: one for the electronic
      health record, and the second for video consultation. The quality of your
      speaker will make a difference to the call. Test your speakers and ensure
      that their volume does not compromise confidentiality, or use a headset.
      Use a dedicated microphone that enables all participants in the consulting
      room to be clearly audible.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Camera—use a full HD 1080p video camera with autofocus and, if
      possible, external privacy shutter. Using a dedicated camera instead
      of—for example—a laptop’s in-built camera, can make a noticeable
      difference.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Tablet or smartphone—these have pros such as portability and easier
      adoption, but also cons such as a smaller screen, a need for a stand, and
      wireless connectivity that is less reliable than wired. Use a dedicated
      practice device, not a private phone or tablet (especially if using
      FaceTime, WhatsApp, or similar for video consultations as these are linked
      to the mobile phone’s number).
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Internet connection—whenever possible, use wired ethernet/broadband
      instead of Wi-Fi/4G as it provides a more consistent connection;
      wireless/mobile connection is more likely to get lag and interference
      which can make video and audio suboptimal.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Internet speed—connection should be at least 1 Mbps speed or have
      strong reception on a 4G mobile network. Requirements are driven by the
      resolution and image motion. Higher speed will enable a better
      experience.<b>
        Prior testing may be necessary to determine the feasibility of video
        consultations.</b
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Latency (lag in internet response)—aim for lower than 200 ms and
      preferably less than 100 ms. Internet speed and latency can be easily
      tested—search the internet for a test.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Registration and installation—use healthcare approved video calling
      software, if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Settings—computer, phone, or tablet may require configuration of
      privacy and other settings for video consultations.
    </li>
    <li>
      &emsp;Interoperability—provide information to patients about the
      interoperability of video consultation systems with common operating
      systems and devices. Aim for wide interoperability, including with older
      operating systems and software, without compromising privacy, security, or
      quality.
