    <h5 class="py-2">Notice of Privacy Practices Regarding Personal Health Information</h5>
    <p>Your<i> Authorization.</i> Except as outlined below, we will not use or disclose your

    <ul>
      <li>We may use and disclose your medical records only for each of the following purposes: treatment, payment,
        and healthcare operation.</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Uses and Disclosures for Treatment.</b> The term treatment as used above means providing, coordinating,
          or managing healthcare and related services by one or more healthcare providers. For instance, doctors,
          nurses and other professionals involved in your care will use information in your medical record and
          information that you provide about your symptoms and reactions to plan a course of treatment for you that
          may include procedures, medications, tests, etc.  We may also release your personal health information to
          another healthcare facility or professional who is not affiliated with medicalWISDOM but who is or will be
          providing treatment to you. For instance, if, after you leave medicalWISDOM, you are going to receive home
          healthcare, we may release your personal health information to that home healthcare agency so that a plan of
          care can be prepared for you.  medicalWISDOM and related physician offices make electronic medical record
          information and results available through electronic health systems to medicalWISDOM related and affiliated
          providers as well as unrelated healthcare providers who agree to access the information for the purpose of
          patient care and treatment. Another example of this is a primary care doctor referring you to a specialist
          doctor for any purpose, including for obtaining a second opinion.</li>
        <li><b>Uses and Disclosures for Payment. </b>The term payment as used above includes but is not limited to
          obtaining reimbursement for Services, confirming insurance coverage, and billing and collecting activities.
          We will use and disclose your personal, protected health information as necessary for the payment purposes
          of those health professionals and facilities that have treated you or provided services to you.  For
          instance, we and the health professionals involved in your care may forward information regarding your
          medical procedures and treatment to your insurance company to arrange payment for the services provided to
          you or we may use your information to prepare a bill to send to you or to the person responsible for your
          payment.</li>
        <li><b>Uses and Disclosures for Healthcare Operations.</b> The term healthcare operations means the business
          aspects of running, assessing, evaluating and improving the functionality and use of the Site and the
          Services by performing quality assessments, audits, and cost management analysis. We will use and disclose
          your personal, protected health information as necessary and as permitted by law, for our healthcare
          operations that include clinical improvement, professional peer review, business management, accreditation
          and licensing, etc.  For instance, we may use and disclose your personal, protected health information for
          purposes of improving the clinical treatment and care of our patients.  We may disclose personal health
          information to doctors, nurses, technicians, medical students, volunteers and other persons for review and
          learning purposes and for the operation of educational programs.  We may also disclose your personal health
          information to another healthcare facility, healthcare professional, or health plan for such things as
          compliance, billing audits, quality assurance and case management, if that facility, professional, or plan
          also has or had a patient relationship with you or is part of the clinically integrated healthcare setting.
        </li>
        <li><b>Family and Friends Involved in Your Care.</b>  With your approval, we may disclose your personal health
          information to designated family, friends, and others who are involved in your care or in payment of your
          care in order to facilitate that person’s involvement in caring for you or paying for your care.  If you are
          unavailable, incapacitated, or facing an emergency medical situation and we determine that a limited
          disclosure may be in your best interest, we may share limited personal health information with such
          individuals without your approval. We may also disclose limited personal health information to a public or
          private entity that is authorized to assist in disaster relief efforts in order for that entity to locate a
          family member or other persons that may be involved in some aspect of caring for you.</li>
        <li><b>Business Associates.</b> Certain components of our services are performed through contracts with
          outside persons or organization such as auditing, accreditation, legal services, etc.  At times it may be
          necessary for us to provide some of your personal, protected health information to one or more of these
          outside persons or organizations who assist us with our healthcare operations.  In all cases, we require
          these business associates to appropriately safeguard the privacy of your information.</li>
        <li><b>Fundraising.</b>  We may contact you to donate to a fundraising effort for or on behalf of our
          non-profit entities.  You have the right to “opt-out” of receiving fundraising materials or communications
          and may do so by emailing medicalWISDOM.</li>
        <li><b>Appointments and Services. </b> We may contact you with appointment reminders or information about
          treatment alternatives or other health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.  You
          have the right to request, and we accommodate reasonable requests, to receive communications regarding your
          personal, protected health information by alternative means or at alternative locations.  For instance, you
          may not want appointment reminders left on voice mail or sent to a particular address and we will
          accommodate reasonable requests.  You may request such confidential communication in writing and may send
          your request to the System Privacy Officer at medicalWISDOM.</li>
        <li><b>Marketing.</b> We do not sell your personal protected health information. We will not engage in
          subsidized communications about health related products or services, with the exception of face-to-face
          communication or promotional items of minimal value, without your authorization. You may revoke such
          authorization in writing.</li>
        <li><b>Research.</b>  In limited circumstances, we may use and disclose your personal, protected health
          information for research purposes.  For example, a researcher may wish to compare outcomes of all patients
          that received a particular drug and will need to review a series of medical records.  In all cases where
          your authorization is not obtained, your privacy will be protected by strict confidentiality requirements
          applied by an Institutional Review Board that oversees the research, or by representations of the
          researchers that limit their use and disclosure of patient information.</li>
        <li><b>Other Uses and Disclosures.</b>  We are permitted or required by law to make certain other uses and
          disclosures of your personal, protected health information without your authorization.  We may release your
